## [Open Sourcing a Python Project the Right Way](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/)

### Project layout (directory structure)

### `setup.py`

### `GitHub` for project management

### `py.test` for unit testing
* Existing tests with `helloworld` are a little naive, add larger/more fringe tests
* Coverage is currently poor, add more tests

### `tox` for testing standardization
* Current `tox.ini` is very basic, make more detailed if necessary

### Sphinx for auto-generated HTML documentation
* ~~Generate basic documentation with Sphinx~~ 
* Add project description etc. and more Sphinx spices

### TravisCI for continuous testing integration

### ReadTheDocs for continuous documentation integration

### `demos/`
* ~~Write helloworld example~~
* Add a larger example (look at `touchpoint` for inspiration)

### `README`
* ~~Flesh out README more~~
* Organize README sectionally to highlight features with code examples (or something like that)
